For this project, I have leverage the base design from Ceevee (https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/), and updated to cater to the technical ask.

## My Input

   1. 'Translated' all code into React
   2. Created two mini-database to pull my personal information
   3. For the 'Bonus' section, updated existing code from Ceevee into a dynamic code that pulls from the cityData array
   4. Made minor updates to CSS

## Main Files to Check
   1. mini-database: cityData.js & resumeData.js
   2. Components folder (header.js, about.js, photos.js, contact.js)
